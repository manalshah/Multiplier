# Multiplier-
Signed Binary Multiplier &amp; Divider Circuit(64-bit )

Implemented a 64-bit Signed Binary Multiplier & Divider Circuit.

Multiplication and division is always a integral part of any processing unit. All the controlling unit acquetizes different task by diving it into many smaller task and complete each small task in predefined time. 

Designers work hard to implement high speed circuits with smallest area. But, area, power and speed always have a tradeoff between them. Increasing the speed.

Multiplication and Division are important computation parameters in many systems. This project is a deign of a multiplication and division circuit using a single 32 bit ALU.
